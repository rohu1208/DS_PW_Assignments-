    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularized regression technique that combines the properties of both Ridge Regression (L2 norm) and Lasso Regression (L1 norm). It aims to overcome some of the limitations of Lasso, particularly when dealing with highly correlated predictors."

    "Zero Coefficients: Indicate predictors that have been excluded from the model, similar to Lasso.\n",
