    "# Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term. It aims to address some limitations of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, particularly when dealing with multicollinearity (high correlation among predictors).\n",

    "Differences from OLS:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS Regression minimizes the sum of squared residuals (differences between observed and predicted values).\n",
    "Ridge Regression minimizes the sum of squared residuals plus a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of coefficients (L2 norm)."

    "No perfect multicollinearity: Perfect multicollinearity is not present among the predictors, though Ridge Regression can handle high, but not perfect, multicollinearity better than OLS.\n",
    "Normality: For inference purposes, the error terms should be normally distributed, though this is less critical for predictive performance."

    "Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?\n",
    "Ridge Regression is not typically used for feature selection directly because it does not shrink coefficients to zero; rather, it shrinks them towards zero. This means all features are retained in the model. However, it can still reduce the impact of less important features by shrinking their coefficients, thus providing some indirect information about feature importance."

    "Yes, Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous independent variables. However, categorical variables need to be properly encoded (e.g., using one-hot encoding) before being used in the model. The regularization will then apply to all coefficients, whether they correspond to continuous or encoded categorical variables."

    "Interpreting coefficients in Ridge Regression is similar to OLS regression, but with the understanding that the coefficients are biased due to regularization. The magnitude of the coefficients is shrunk towards zero, indicating their relative importance. Larger coefficients (in absolute value) suggest a stronger relationship with the response variable, but because of the bias introduced, care must be taken when making inferences solely based on their size."
