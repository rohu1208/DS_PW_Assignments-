    "# Q1. What is Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used for determining conditional probabilities. It describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In other words, it updates the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available."
